# Python-Turtle-Paths

I solve the Turle Python Paths problem by 3 approaches

i) I have 6 directions' files hence I create 6 Turtles and each Turtle will progfress its path one-by-one

ii) I have 6 Turtles for 6 directions' files and they all progress together at the same time using normal FOR loops

iii) I have 6 Turtles for 6 directions' files, hence I use 6 Threads (multi-threading programming) to make 6 Turtles progressing their paths concurrently
