# Python-Turtle-Paths

I solve the Turle Python Paths problem by 3 approaches

i) I have 6 directions' files hence I create 6 Turtles and each Turtle will progfress its path one-by-one

ii) I have 6 Turtles for 6 directions' files and they all progress together at the same time using normal FOR loops

iii) I have 6 Turtles for 6 directions' files, hence I use 6 Threads (multi-threading programming) to make 6 Turtles progressing their paths concurrently

I am making Python programs by using PyCharm IDE for Windows from here

I) Six Turtles progress one after another, the next Turtle will progress after the previous Turtle has done

For example, after the Blue Turtle that goes for path of directions-1.txt file, then the Green Turtle progress as below
